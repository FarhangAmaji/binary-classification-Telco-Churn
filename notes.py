thoughts:
    maybe change it to ipynb

the done steps would have #done before them
steps to do:
    machine learning approaches:
        do data cleaning:
            #done add 'tenure' meaning
            #done Dropping duplicated
            #done drop missing values
            #done change categorical to multiple cols
            #done handle outliers;plot before and after plot for numerical cols outlier
            #done show input data imbalances
            #done 'optional default not to do oversampling' for imbalances
            #notNow add comment 'for other imbalances and outlier options'
            think about other methods may needed
            
        
        EDA(exploratory data analysis):
            #ccc not a necessity, I have more important things to do
            'Correlation Analysis' and 'Heatmap'(maybe useful, I may do it after all steps)
        
        do first model:
            #done Hyperparameter Tuning
            #done 5fold Cross-validation
            #kkk add subSteps later
        
        explain output data:
            with confusion matrices,roc and auc plots, accuracy,recall, f1score,Cohen kappa score,... or top features affecting the model    
            add explaination on 'what metrics better to be chosen'
        
        add 2nd model:
            try to make a system to do it in a func with 5fold Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
        
        rest of models:
            find Hyperparameters
            test if they fit to general func to do model and explain output results
            dont forget to do a commit after adding each model
            add the libraries needed to requirements.txt
        
        apply clean Architecture and code principles and TDD and DDD as possible:
            #kkk add subSteps later as needed
        
        do ensemble model:
            #kkk add subSteps
        
        take a look what further I can imporve:
            #kkk add the list of imporvements here
        

    deep learning approaches(should be done after 'ml approaches'):
        try vae classification
        try lstm
        try monte carlo dropout
